The UNIX-like operating system I decided to choose is Ubuntu since it is said to be more beginner and user-friendly and being new to it decided to install as dual boot.
 
 Met with a problem: Windows wouldn’t let me shrink the volume because there were immovable system files at the very end of the volume, gladly could solve it.
 
 Installed the “starting pack” of a software engineer on my machine: zsh, oh-my-zsh, Git, gcc compiler, ide/editor(Visual Studio Code)
 
 Created a Git repository through the command line.
